# Snake-Xenzia

A modular, object-oriented implementation of the classic Snake game using Python’s built-in turtle graphics library.
The project emphasizes clear separation of concerns, deterministic game logic, and maintainable design.

# Overview

Snake Xenzia recreates the traditional Snake gameplay loop: continuous movement, directional control, food consumption, score progression, and game-over conditions. The codebase is structured into independent modules, each responsible for a distinct subsystem of the game.
The project is intended as a learning-oriented but well-architected implementation, suitable for studying event-driven programming, basic game loops, and object-oriented design in Python.
